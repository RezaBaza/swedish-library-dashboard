# Swedish Library Data Analysis Dashboard

An interactive dashboard for analyzing Swedish library loan data from 2000 to 2012, featuring a hybrid approach combining direct data analysis and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Features

### 1. Chatbot Interface
Ask natural language questions about the data and get accurate answers:
- "Which region had the highest number of loans in 2012?"
- "How many total loans were there in TÃ¤by for 2008?"
- "What was the trend in library loans over the years?"
- "How did Stockholm's loans change from 2000 to 2012?"

### 2. Data Explorer
Browse and filter the raw data by:
- Region
- Year
- Media Type

View summary statistics and download filtered data as CSV.

### 3. Interactive Dashboards
Visualize the data with interactive charts:
- **Loans by Region**: Compare loan volumes across different regions
- **Loans vs Population**: Analyze the relationship between population size and loan volumes
- **Trends Over Time**: Track changes in loan patterns over the years

## Technology Stack

- **Streamlit**: Web application framework
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Plotly**: Interactive visualizations
- **Sentence Transformers**: Vector embeddings for semantic search
- **ChromaDB**: Vector database for storing embeddings
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Language models for question answering

## How It Works

The application uses a hybrid approach to answer questions:

1. **Direct Data Analysis**: For specific, structured questions about loans, regions, and years, the system performs direct data analysis using pandas.

2. **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: For more contextual questions, the system uses a RAG approach that:
   - Retrieves relevant information from a vector database
   - Generates natural language answers based on the retrieved context

## Data Source

The dataset includes library loan statistics from Swedish municipalities from 2000 to 2012, covering different media types and including population data for per-capita analysis.
